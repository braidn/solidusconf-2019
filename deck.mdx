# A few years ago

</Split>

<Notes>

I was up on a stage, much like this, 
in front of many of you all talking about 
hot to inject Empathy in REST APIs.

I ended that talk with a hypothesis that GraphQL 
could be more a way to build a "More Empathic" API interface.

# Then Last Year

</Split>

<Notes>

I got up on stage and shared how Empathy and GraphQL could go hand and hand. 
However like REST, the technology wasn't the path to Empathy. 
Empathic solutions stemmed from the team implementing the feature.

# Self-Awareness

<Notes>
Self awareness shows itself in people where they understand their emotions. 
They also don't allow these emotions to control or direct them. 
Due to this, these humans tend to embody a lot of self confidence.

Due to all of this, these people tend to understand their own weakeness (and strengths). 
They work on them actively and better themselves consistently.
</Notes>

---

# Self-Regulation

<Notes>
People who embody self-regulation are folks who think actively before they act. 
Due to this, they tend not to get too jealous or too angry. 
They control their emotions and often times appear none plussed most of the time.
</Notes>

---

# Motivation

<Notes>
Motivated people take challenges 'head on'. 
They are often times highly productive and 
almost always reach for spaces to trade immediate gratification to long-term success.
</Notes>

# Empathy

<Notes>
I have talked about this extensivelly in my previous two Solidus Conf talks. 
However for those who missed it, 
Empathy is the (usually superhuman) ability to recognize the needs and emotions of the folks around you.
These people are quick to manage relations, listen, and relate to others around them. 
They almost always act in open and welcoming ways.
</Notes>

# Social Skills

<Notes>
Folks who are masters at building relationships are often times display high emotional intelligence. 
They are often seen as team players who reach to uplift others instead of making themselves look great.
