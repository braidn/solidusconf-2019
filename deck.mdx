# A few years ago

</Split>

<Notes>

I was up on a stage, much like this, 
in front of many of you all talking about 
hot to inject Empathy in REST APIs.

I ended that talk with a hypothesis that GraphQL 
could be more a way to build a "More Empathic" API interface.

# Then Last Year

<Notes>

I got up on stage and shared how Empathy and GraphQL could go hand and hand. 
However like REST, the technology wasn't the path to Empathy. 
Empathic solutions stemmed from the team implementing the feature.

# Emotional Intelligence ?

> The capability of individuals to recognize their own emotions and those of others, 
  discern between different feelings and label them appropriately, 
  use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior, and manage and/or adjust emotions to adapt to environments or achieve one's goal(s)

<h1> 1. Self-Awareness </h1>
</Horizontal>

<Notes>
Self awareness shows itself in people where they understand their emotions. 
They also don't allow these emotions to control or direct them. 
Due to this, these humans tend to embody a lot of self confidence.

Due to all of this, these people tend to understand their own weakeness (and strengths). 
They work on them actively and better themselves consistently.

<h1>Self-Regulation</h1>

<Notes>
People who embody self-regulation are folks who think actively before they act. 
Due to this, they tend not to get too jealous or too angry. 
They control their emotions and often times appear none plussed most of the time.

<h1>Empathy</h1>
</Horizontal>

<Notes>
I have talked about this extensivelly in my previous two Solidus Conf talks. 
However for those who missed it, 
Empathy is the (usually superhuman) ability to recognize the needs and emotions of the folks around you.
These people are quick to manage relations, listen, and relate to others around them. 
They almost always act in open and welcoming ways.

# The Monolith

<Notes>
Easy to implement and especially easy to E2E test, 
the majestic monolith is almost always a wonderful starting poing for a company. 
They tend to be easy to deploy and scale 
with a simple load balancer and many instances serving a 'nearly' unlimited amount of traffic.

<H2>Structure</H2>
</Image>

<Notes>
We all know what a Monolith feels like when head first in one's development. 
We have worked in and around Solidus/Spree and Rails for the better half of a decade... 
And some of us even more.
Moving from this monolith to a microservices like 
structure isn't something that should be done because someone mentioned it on Medium.

Breaking up these beasts takes a concerted amount of consideration both, 
from the team perspective but, also from an architectural one.

Perhaps microservices isn't the first stop in this process, 
and maybe using our new EQ skills, we can discern if the team is ready for the move.
</Notes>

# Why Not A Rewrite?

<Notes>
Before we start down this microservices road, 
we need to first answer this question. 

As of maybe even 5 years ago it was very envogue to rewrite an entire system if a team came to a grinding halt. 
This would mean the original application would go into 'read only' and 
the entire dev team would port functionality from one application to another. 

In our world that might mean Rails 5, Rails 6, Solidus 2.8, etc. 
Afterwards we would stand up the new stack, import the data and roll over traffic from one application to the other...
</Notes>

---

# Rewrite Scare

<Notes>
If you aren't scared now, 
this talk and maybe an incremental move to microservices may not be for you. 
Most folks have gone through a move like this more than once, 
and the idea of micrervices or an incremental move to an updated and fast system peaks all of our interests.
</Notes>

# How Do Microservices Intersect Emotional Intelligence

<Notes>
Now that we have gone over the basics of emotional intelligence, 
how do these ideas intersect with the idea of microservices?

Well... funny you should ask, 
the answer came about from one of the epic tomes of software management and development...

<Notes>
written in 1975, Fred Books quoted Melvin Conway's Harvard business review paper called:
How Do Committee's Invent?. 
In that paper, Conway presented the following thesis about teams

# Conway's law

> Any organization that designs a system (defined more broadly here than just information systems) 
> will inevitably produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure

# A Litmus Test

<Notes>
Before we move directly onto microservices, 
what's a good way to tell if a team is feeling the correct amount of pain to warrant the transition? 
What's that perfect litmus test that can tell lead product owners to start this transition?
</Notes>

---

# Who Owns What?

<Notes>
Blurred lines of ownership across teams in a monolith can lead to some 'interesting cross-team dynamics'. 
Without clear boundaries (offered by microservices), 
it's easy for teams to step on other team's toes, 
be steeped in building features without clear decision making, 
and ultimatly stagnating features that may never be deployed.


</Notes>

---

# Microservices The Very Beginning

<Notes>
This is a good thing though. 
There is a required feeling or explicit pain that a team needs to have before ever thinking about moving to microservices. 
The idea being that a freedom of data, or deployments or services will lead to a freedom of said pain. 

The rest of the talk will focus purely on this world. 
How do the 5 parts of emotional intelligence help inform successful software teams to build and designs successuful starts to microservices.

# Tiny Groupings Of Functionality

<Notes>
Biting off the first piece of functionality might be the hardest part of this process. 
To often though folks reach for the most painful item that's causing issues.

Due to this, the first approach here can be the end all of this whole process. 

Using empathy here is almost always the first move. 
We log into our Slack channels and try to discern developers pain through reading chat ops channels. 
However, if we want to avoid the failure into tiny groupings, 
there is a much more concrete piece of EQ that can be utilized.

Self-awareness

# Tiny Groupings of Self Awareness

<Notes>
Sometimes called event storming, 
this is an integral part of Domain Driven Design and often times what small groups of developers do prior to breaking a monolith apart.
