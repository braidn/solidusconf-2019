# A few years ago

<Notes>

I was up on a stage, much like this, 
in front of many of you all talking about 
hot to inject Empathy in REST APIs.

I ended that talk with a hypothesis that GraphQL 
could be more a way to build a "More Empathic" API interface.

<Notes>

I got up on stage and shared how Empathy and GraphQL could go hand and hand. 
However like REST, the technology wasn't the path to Empathy. 
Empathic solutions stemmed from the team implementing the feature.

> The capability of individuals to recognize their own emotions and those of others, 
  discern between different feelings and label them appropriately, 
  use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior, and manage and/or adjust emotions to adapt to environments or achieve one's goal(s)

<Notes>
Self awareness shows itself in people where they understand their emotions. 
They also don't allow these emotions to control or direct them. 
Due to this, these humans tend to embody a lot of self confidence.

Due to all of this, these people tend to understand their own weakeness (and strengths). 
They work on them actively and better themselves consistently.

<H2>Structure</H2>
</Image>

<Notes>
We all know what a Monolith feels like when head first in one's development. 
We have worked in and around Solidus/Spree and Rails for the better half of a decade... 
And some of us even more.
Moving from this monolith to a microservices like 
structure isn't something that should be done because someone mentioned it on Medium.

Breaking up these beasts takes a concerted amount of consideration both, 
from the team perspective but, also from an architectural one.

Perhaps microservices isn't the first stop in this process, 
and maybe using our new EQ skills, we can discern if the team is ready for the move.
</Notes>

# Why Not A Rewrite?

<Notes>
Before we start down this microservices road, 
we need to first answer this question. 

As of maybe even 5 years ago it was very envogue to rewrite an entire system if a team came to a grinding halt. 
This would mean the original application would go into 'read only' and 
the entire dev team would port functionality from one application to another. 

In our world that might mean Rails 5, Rails 6, Solidus 2.8, etc. 
Afterwards we would stand up the new stack, import the data and roll over traffic from one application to the other...

<Notes>
If you aren't scared now, 
this talk and maybe an incremental move to microservices may not be for you. 
Most folks have gone through a move like this more than once, 
and the idea of a micrervices approach or 
an incremental move to an updated and fast system should

# Before the Beginning

<Notes>
# Solution 0.5
Before we move directly into microservices, 
what's a good way to tell if a team is feeling the correct amount of pain to warrant the transition? 
What's that perfect litmus test that can lead product owners to start this transition?
</Notes>

---

# The Actual Beginning

<Notes>
There is a required feeling or explicit pain that a team needs to have before ever thinking about moving to microservices. 
The idea being that a freedom of data, or deployments or services will lead to a freedom of said pain. 

The rest of the talk will focus purely on this world. 
How do the 5 parts of emotional intelligence help inform successful software teams 
to build and designs successuful starts to microservices.

# Solution 1

Blurred lines of ownership across teams in a monolith can lead to some 'interesting cross-team dynamics'. 
Without clear boundaries (offered by microservices), 
it's easy for teams to step on other team's toes, 
find themselves building features without clear decision making, 
and ultimatly stagnating without hope of successuful production deployments

Trust is a huge part of successful team ownership. 
Teams that don't trust each other likely have a harder time defining parts of the product they own. 
The less trust a team has the, more blurred these lines of ownership become.

Increasing trust it come over night but, 
can often times be witnessed in how vulnerable is each member of a team willing to be.

- Self Awareness

Each member, 
using tools like DiSC can help each member of the team see how they are perceived by the world around them. 
This can lead them to discussing how each other fits in with the overall team. 
How their strengths improve and support the team, 
along with how other's strengths may support their weakeness.

<Notes>
# Solution 2

Biting off the first piece of functionality might be the hardest part of this process. 
Too often folks reach for the most painful/or most 'sticky' item that's causing issues.

Using empathy is almost always the first move. 
We log into our Slack channels and try to discern developers pain through reading chat ops or deploy channels. 
However, if we want to avoid the failure of tiny groupings, 
there is a much more concrete piece of emotional intelligence that can be utilized.

- Social Skills

Sometimes called event storming, 
this methodology
involves discovering key domain events and plotting them along a time series.
this is an integral part of Domain Driven Design and often times what small groups of developers do prior to breaking a monolith apart. 

It just can't work without utilizing key domain experts from accross the company. 
One of the key takeaways of almost all event storming sessions is the conversation between participants. 
This shared knowledge is key to future modeling processes, 
software that might fall out of these ideas, 
and a better understanding of the current and future business processes.

None of this is possible without the convergence of domain experts and effective social skills during this process of 'event storming'.

</Notes>

# Coupling (De-Coupling)

<Notes>
# Solution 3

Interfaces are a natural move to reduce coupling. 
Often times the best way to do this is to use a term known as 'outside-in' thinking.

This means that we think of solutions from the point of the consumer first. 
Afterwards, work your way backwards to implement the service contracts.

- Empathy

This is a classic use of empathy and something that I advocated for actively in the past 5 years 
and coincidentally, in my past two SolidusConf talks.
However, 
empathy is by far one of the hardest tactics of the emotional intelligence belt to master.

Outside-in thinking can be distilled to the idea of:

> seeing issues from from multiple perspectives (not only your own)

Intel's CEO Andy Grove is one of the most well known outside in thinkers. 
He was (he died in 2016) known for pushing Intel's management to constantly be anticipating changes in their corporate landscape. 
The result of this? Intel pivoted somewhat early on from memory storage to semi conductors (and we know the rest of the story).

When designing interfaces for your first or next microservices, 
be thinking about the API layer from a customer's perspective. 
Noodle on what information should be pushed away from these consumers 
as much as the shape of responses and required inputs.

How can you as a designer anticipate the changing landscape like Andy Grove did for Intel all those years ago?

<h1>Freedom of Languages</h1>
</Image>

<Notes>
# Solution 4

There is a large ecosystem of languages out there. 
And when the idea to move to micrervices emerges, 
everyone will want to re-write the world in Rust...
or Elm. 

- Self Regulation

Understanding that team churn is a very real thing that all organizations deal with, 
means being conservative when choosing languages for a new service. 
Build the service using some language that the team is currently 'good' at. 

If the use case of the service grows beyond the capabilities of the language or platform, 
the service layer should be small enough that a rewrite in Rust is feasable.
Saying that though guage how much interest the current team has in emerging languages.

Weighting these decisions before jumping into the microservices pool is a great demonstration of self regulation

- Motivation

The opposite of the above may be useful in weighing this move as well.

Poke around the public repositories that fellow engineers have on GitHub or GitLab. 
Namely, those that have high commit activity outside of work hours. 
These are the individuals that are displaying motivation in the exploration of potentially powerful new languages.

They find playing with these languages deeply fullfilling (who doesn't) 
and may have great ideas about how they can be used in the next performance strained service.

# A Package For All

<Notes>
## Solution 5

When's the last time that we have published something to GemFury, GitHub or RubyGems? 
With packaging dependencies and publishing them to consumers, 
we create clear boundaries not only in our service layer but in our shareable code.

With services running in all kinds of different environments, 
having sharable, 
well tested and specific dependencies allows teams to not only move faster but, 
Makes sharing code across applications much more possible. 
No longer is a change to a piece of code going to create havoc in fulfillment. 

Fullfillment can continue to use version 1.1 while the Aquisition team uses a more recent tagged version.

## Motivation X Empathy

This is a key success metric to how ready a team is to move to microservices however, 
it does blur the lines between two sections of emotional intelligence.

## Motivation

In one space, it takes a lot of time to be a good package maintainer, 
even if that package is only consumed internally. 
There are decisions around versioning numbers, 
how and where the package will be available 
(does everyone have access to the GitHub package repository or GitLab's package registry?), 
and so much more. 

Are your current developers versed in package dispersal, 
do they maintain open source libraries with these requirements, 
etc?

If so then they definitely have the motivation and expertise to do so within the organization. 
If not? 
Well then this might be a wonderful opportunity to grow and educate the team.

## Empathy

When building consumable code for other developers, 
be it a tiny module to a full framework, 
understanding how to be a mindful or empathic package producer can be tricky at best. 

Let's take NPM and Node Modules as an example:

1. How do you build something that is inherently small? 
The heft and weight of many node modules is a bit rediculous. 
1. This leads to where will this code run? 
Can this module be published as well to a CDN and pulled into the front end asynchronously?
1. What are the public methods to your package? 
What's the smallest API layer that you can release while still thinking about how the consumer will use the code?

These are just some of the myriad of human specific questions that package maintainers need to think about before 
they ever type `npm publish`

<h1>Docs, Docs, Docs</h1>
</Image>

<Notes>
## Solution 6 (Final)

In many scenarios, 
an application is reliant on a constant DB to DB connection to manage interactions throughout the App. 
This isn't and shouldn't be the case with a switch to microservices. 
Any new, service will talk to any other service through an API layer. 
This could be a GraphQl/REST/Protobuf layer. 
Regardless, each service won't be sharing the Db connection.

How does your team currently document the existing API layer? 
How do they see documentation as a whole? 
Restructuring around documentation might need to be something that's instilled in the current team, 
before splitting layers into microservices.

## Social Skills

Building useful documentation is all about those social skills. 
Communicating intent of your services API layer isn't going to be a trivial process. 
This coupled with understanding how your users will consume your documentation, 
propose edits or updates, 
and even interact with perhaps a fake or development version of your service, 
all lead back to clear and concise communication.

If you haven't seen my previous talk on Empathic REST API's from 2016, 
that talk also had some wonderful findings that intersected documentation and empathy.

Or how robust is your test suite,

How will you know that your ultimate implementation works without an existing and 
healthy test suite?

## All Of Them.

The fascinating aspect of automated testing and 
especially a good, 
well groomed and 
above all else: 
fast test suite is that it intersects all five parts of emotional intelligence:

1. _Self Awareness_: Developers need to take stock of how they feel when they run a single file in the suite or the whole suite. 
Is it painful? 
Do the tests not function without connection to the internet? 
What feeling does the suite invoke across the entire organization? 
1. _Self Regulation_: Do developers make rational choices with information (ie Failed Builds) from the test suite? 
1. _Social Skills_: Are developers open to talking about slow tests? 
Is testing methodologies or betterment something that's spoken about over the lunch table? 
1. _Empathy_: To understand how slow tests or broken builds might adversely affect the rest of the team.
1. _Motivation_: And lastly, how motivated are developers to dig into particularly sticky parts of the test suite?

There is a lot more information codified in books around EQ. 
Sure, the web maybe a great place to find how to scaffold your next React App but, 
quality EQ based articles are few and far apart.

And who has played with FaastRuby before a few months ago?

It was a very accessible way to write Ruby or Crystal (_highlight this by raising your finger_)
functions that were extremely easily deployed and ran on demand.
