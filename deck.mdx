# A few years ago

</Split>

<Notes>

I was up on a stage, much like this, 
in front of many of you all talking about 
hot to inject Empathy in REST APIs.

I ended that talk with a hypothesis that GraphQL 
could be more a way to build a "More Empathic" API interface.

# Then Last Year

<Notes>

I got up on stage and shared how Empathy and GraphQL could go hand and hand. 
However like REST, the technology wasn't the path to Empathy. 
Empathic solutions stemmed from the team implementing the feature.
