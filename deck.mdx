# About Me

</Image>

<Notes>

If you haven't heard of Glossier before, 
We are a skin-first beauty and ecommerce company.
Some of us have spoken at past Spree and Solidus conferences throughout the years.

For my specific day to day,
I spend my time making our internal tooling a wonderful experience but, 
have worked on almost all teams throughout the engineering organization at Glossier.

# Why No Tech Talks

</Horizontal>

<Notes>

I get this a lot actually and really my usual answers are terrible. 
They involve sidestepping the fact by claiming that I do them _only_ in more intimate settings. 
This means only our local meetups and small regional conferences get to see my 'harder talks'

HOWEVER, this year I have a great excuse!

_Let everyone bare witness to the large JS image_

That's right! I have basically taken a back seat on Ruby and 
up until several months ago, bathed esclusively in the 'glow' that is JavaScript and GraphQL.
If anyone want's to talk about these pieces of technology afterwards, 
come find me.

This talk, like most starts with a little history...

# A few years ago

</Split>

<Notes>

A few years ago I was up on a stage, much like this, 
in front of many of you all talking about 
how to inject Empathy in REST APIs.

I ended that talk with a hypothesis:

that GraphQL could be a way to build a "More Empathic" API interface.

# Then Last Year

![](https://artandlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/graphQl.png)

</Split>

<Notes>

Skipping a few years forward, 
last year I returned with a follow up hypothesis: 

how Empathy and GraphQL could go hand and hand. 

However like REST, 
the technology wasn't the path to Empathy. 
Ultimatly I found that there was a single truth that ran between both these talks:

The fact that empathic solutions stemmed from the team implementing the feature, not the technology.

<Notes>

Let's start with IMHO, the hardest section of this talk.

The term 'Emotional Intelligence' was coined by this human (Daniel Goleman) in a book titled: 
_'Emotional Intelligence - Why It Can Matter More Than IQ'_
In it, Daniel split the brain into two different forms, 
one driven by pure logic and one aiding humans with their 'instinctive' feelings.

</Notes>

# Emotional Intelligence ?

> The capability of individuals to recognize their own emotions and those of others, 
  discern between different feelings and label them appropriately, 
  use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior, and manage and/or adjust emotions to adapt to environments or achieve one's goal(s)

<Notes>

Daniel claimed that emotional intelligence was...

<h1> Starts in 5 parts </h1>
</Image>

<Notes>

Daniel also split this concept of emotional intelligence up into five seperate parts. 
Each one a distinctive camp, with its own rules, strengths and weakenesses.

Let's take some time to go over each one of these sections in 
hopes that we all better understand what makes up the entirety of emotional intelligence.

<h1> 1. Self-Awareness </h1>
</Horizontal>

<Notes>

Self awareness shows itself in people where they understand their emotions. 
They also don't allow these emotions to control or direct them. 
Due to this, these people tend to embody a lot of self confidence.
People who have high self awareness understand what they are doing as much as why they are doing it.

Motivated people take challenges 'head on'. 
For engineers, 
this is the easiest part of emotional intelligence to understand.
People who are motivated are often times highly productive and 
almost always reach for spaces to trade immediate gratification to long-term success.

<h1>Empathy</h1>
</Horizontal>

<Notes>

I have spokent about the topic of empathy extensivelly in my previous two Solidus Conf talks. 
However for those who missed them, 
Empathy is the (usually superhuman) ability to recognize the needs and emotions of the folks around you.
These people are quick to manage relations, listen, and relate to others around them. 
Is there a member of your team who always is welcoming and opening in code reviews or 
pull requests? Empathic asynchronous communication is a hallmark of people with high emotional intelligence

<h1>Social Skills</h1>
</Horizontal>

<Notes>

Folks who are masters at building relationships are often times display high emotional intelligence. 
They are seen as team players who reach to uplift others instead of making themselves look great.
Social skills, 
within the scope of emotional intelligence, 
can also include none verbal skills. 
For example smiling at someone usually makes them smile back. 
This exchange of smiles can aid in positivity of both parties.

<Notes>

Easy to implement and especially easy to E2E test, 
the majestic monolith is almost always a wonderful starting poing for a company. 
They tend to be easy to deploy and scale 
with a simple load balancer and many instances serving a 'nearly' unlimited amount of traffic.
We all know what a Monolith feels like when head first in one's development. 
We have worked in and around Solidus/Spree and Rails for the better half of a decade... 
And some of us even more.

<H2>Structure</H2>

<Notes>

Moving from this monolith to a microservices like 
structure isn't something that should be done because someone mentioned it on Medium.
Breaking up these beasts takes a concerted amount of consideration both, 
from a team and architectual perspective.
Perhaps jumping immediatly to microservices isn't the first stop in this process. 
Could we use our new EQ skills to discern if the team is ready for the move regardless 
of what the application performance metrics are telling us?

# Why Not A Rewrite?

<Notes>

Before we go any further
we need to first answer this question. 
As of maybe even 5 years ago it was very envogue to rewrite an entire system 
even if it meant a team coming to a grinding feature-halt. 
The original application would go into 'read only' and 
the entire dev team would port functionality from one application to another. 
In our world that might mean a rewrite to Rails 5, Rails 6, Solidus 2.8, etc. 
Afterwards we would stand up the new stack, import the data and roll over traffic from one application to the other...

<h2>Be Afraid!</h2>
</Image>

<Notes>

If you aren't scared now, 
this talk and maybe an incremental move to microservices may not be for you. 
However,
most folks have gone through a move like this more than once. 
The idea of a micrervices approach or 
an incremental move should be a much less stressful idea.

</Notes>

# Fowler Said...

> almost all the cases where I’ve heard of a system that was built as a microservice system from scratch, 
> it has ended in serious trouble… you shouldn’t start a new project with microservices, 
> even if you’re sure your application will be big enough to make it worthwhile”.

<Notes>

Lastly before we jump into microservices, this quote from Martin Fowler
in a blog post titled: _Monolith First_ really says it all. 

Act fast, build a Monolith until it hurts and then break it up when you are ready

<Notes>

Blurred lines of ownership across teams in a monolith can lead to some 'interesting cross-team dynamics'. 
Without clear boundaries (offered by microservices), 
it's easy for teams to step on other team's toes, 
find themselves building features without clear decision making, 
and ultimatly stagnating without hope of successuful production deployments. 
Trust is a huge part of successful team ownership. 
Teams that don't trust each other likely have a harder time defining parts of the product they own. 
The less trust a team has the, more blurred these lines of ownership become.
Increasing trust doesn't come over night but,
often times it can be witnessed in how vulnerable 
each member of a team is willing to be.

- Self Awareness

Each member, 
using assessment tools like DiSC, 
can teach other team members how everyone else on the team percieves the world.
This can lead members to discuss how each other fits in with the overall team. 
How their strengths improve and support the team, 
along with how other's strengths may support their weaknesses.

</Horizontal>

<Notes>

Slicing away the first microservice might be the hardest part of this process. 
Too often folks reach for the most painful/or most 'sticky' item that's causing issues.
Using empathy is almost always the first move. 
We log into our Slack channels and try to discern developers pain through reading chat ops or deploy channels. 
However, there is a much more concrete piece of emotional intelligence that can be utilized over empathy.

- Social Skills

A team activity called 'Event Storming' can be a great way to find space to separate the monolith
this methodology
involves discovering key domain events and plotting them along a time series.
this is an integral part of Domain Driven Design.
Event Storming can't work without utilizing key domain experts from accross the company. 
One of the key takeaways of almost all event storming sessions is the conversation between participants. 
This shared knowledge and conversation is key to future modeling processes and 
a better understanding of the current and future business processes.
None of this is possible without the convergence of domain experts and effective social skills during the event storming sessions.

# Coupling (De-Coupling)

</Horizontal>

<Notes>

Interfaces are a natural move to reduce coupling. 
Often times the best way to do this is to use a term known as 'outside-in' thinking.
This means that we think of solutions from the point of the consumer first. 
Afterwards, work your way backwards to implement the service contracts or APIs.

- Empathy

This is a classic use of empathy and something that I advocated for actively in the past 5 years 
and coincidentally, in my past two SolidusConf talks.
However, 
empathy is by far one of the hardest tactics of the emotional intelligence belt to master.
Outside-in thinking can be distilled into a simple mental framework of 

_look at issues from multiple perspectives (not only your own)_

A Story

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digitaltrends-uploads-prod/2013/07/intel-logo.jpg)

</Split>

<Notes>

Intel's CEO Andy Grove is one of the most well known outside in thinkers. 
He was (he died in 2016) known for pushing Intel's management to constantly be anticipating changes in their corporate landscape. 
The result of this? 
Intel pivoted somewhat early on from memory storage to semi conductors (and we know the rest of the story).

When designing interfaces for your first or next microservice, 
be thinking about the API layer from a customer's perspective. 
Noodle on what information should be pushed away from these consumers 
as much as the shape of responses and required inputs.
How can you as a designer anticipate the changing landscape like Andy Grove did for Intel all those years ago?

<h1>Freedom of Languages</h1>
</Image>

<Notes>

There is a large ecosystem of languages out there. 
And when the idea to move to micrervices emerges, 
everyone will want to re-write the world in Rust...
or Elm. 

- Self Regulation

Understanding that team churn is a very real thing that all organizations deal with, 
means being conservative when choosing languages for a new service. 
Build the service using some language that the team is currently 'good' at. 
If the use case of the service grows beyond the capabilities of the language or platform, 
the service layer should be small enough that a rewrite in Rust is feasable.
Saying that though, guage how much interest the current team has in emerging languages.
Weighting these decisions before jumping into the microservices pool is a great demonstration of self regulation

<Notes>

- Motivation

The opposite of the above may be useful in weighing this move as well.
Poke around the public repositories that fellow engineers have on GitHub or GitLab. 
Namely, those that have high commit activity outside of work hours. 
These are the individuals that are displaying motivation in the exploration of potentially powerful new languages.
They find playing with these languages deeply fullfilling (who doesn't) 
and may have great ideas about how they can be used in the next performance strained service.

# A Package For All

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*_iNboVBMYZqRhao6OwNYFg.png)

</Split>

<Notes>

When's the last time that we have published something to GemFury, GitHub or RubyGems? 
With packaging dependencies and publishing them to consumers, 
we create clear boundaries not only in our service layer but in our shareable code.
With services running in all kinds of different environments, 
having sharable, 
well tested and specific dependencies allows teams to not only move faster but, 
Makes sharing code across applications much more possible. 
No longer is a change to a piece of the account page going to create havoc in fulfillment. 
Fullfillment can continue to use version 1.1 while the Aquisition team uses a more recent tagged version.

- Motivation

In one space, it takes a lot of time to be a good package maintainer, 
even if that package is only consumed internally. 
There are decisions around versioning numbers, 
how and where the package will be available 
(does everyone have access to the GitHub package repository or GitLab's package registry?), 
and so much more. 
Are your current developers versed in package dispersal and 
do they maintain open source libraries with these requirements? 
If so then they definitely have the motivation and expertise to do so within the organization. 
If not? 
Well then this might be a wonderful opportunity to grow and educate the team.

<h1>Docs, Docs, Docs</h1>

<Notes>

In many scenarios, 
an application is reliant on a constant DB to DB connection to manage interactions throughout the App. 
This isn't and shouldn't be the case with a switch to microservices. 
Any new, service will talk to any other service through an API layer. 
This could be a GraphQl/REST/Protobuf layer. 
Regardless, 
each service _won't_ be sharing the Db connection.

How does your team currently document their existing API layer? 
How do they see documentation as a whole? 
Restructuring around documentation might need to be something that's instilled in the current team, 
before splitting layers into microservices.

- Social Skills

Building useful documentation is also about social skills. 
Communicating intent of your services API layer isn't going to be a trivial process. 
This coupled with understanding how your users will consume your documentation, 
propose edits or updates, 
and even interact with perhaps a fake or development version of your service, 
all lead back to clear and concise communication.

# 💯 % Test Health

<Notes>

Lastly let's talk about everyone's pet peev.
How robust is your test suite, 
especially the integration and feature part? 
Although we mentioned earlier that this move to microservices isn't a rewrite... 
It is to some extent. 
How will you know that your new implementation works without an existing and 
healthy test suite?

A good, 
well groomed and 
above all else: 
fast test suite actually intersects all five parts of emotional intelligence:

1. _Self Awareness_: Developers need to take stock of how they feel when they run a single file in the suite or the whole suite. 
Is it painful? 
Do the tests not function without connection to the internet? 
What feeling does the suite invoke across the entire organization? 
1. _Self Regulation_: Do developers make rational choices with information (ie Failed Builds) from the test suite? 
1. _Social Skills_: Are developers open to talking about slow tests (either positively or negatively)? 
Is testing methodologies or betterment something that's more triggering than helpful to other members of the team?
1. _Empathy_: Everyone should strive to understand how slow tests or broken builds might adversely affect the rest of the team.
1. _Motivation_: And lastly, how motivated are developers to dig into particularly sticky parts of the test suite?

<Notes>

More than anything,
I would love to thank Glossier for all they do for the Ruby based E-commerce community. 
With Solidus and then with Spree, 
there's so much going on in this space and Glossier is excited to be a part of it.

# EQ Read More Links

- https://www.mindtools.com/
- https://hbr.org/topic/emotional-intelligence
- Go Suck A Lemon (Book)
- Primal Leadership (Book)
- The War for Kindness (Book)

<Notes>

If folks are looking for some good places to start their EQ journey, 
these are some solid links and books

There is a lot more information codified in books around EQ (still). 
Sure, the web maybe a great place to find how to scaffold your next React App but, 
quality EQ based articles are few and far apart.

# Microservices Read More Links

- https://www.martinfowler.com
- https://samnewman.io/
- Domain Driven Design (Book) 
- Domain Driven Design Distilled (Book)

<Notes>

And if you are just thinking about getting into Microservices, 
I highly recommend checking out Martin Fowler and Sam Newman's work on this area. 

It's fairly platform independant 
and Sam's microservices book is getting a rewrite for 2019/2020 with updated content.

And who has played with FaastRuby before a few months ago?
It was a very accessible way to write Ruby or Crystal (_highlight this by raising your finger_)
functions that were extremely easily deployed 
and ran on demand.
Very much like what Zeit is for the JavaScript/Functions as a service, 
or Heroku is for more 'traditional Ruby apps'

<Notes>

As of a few days ago Tobi mentioned this.
Big things are happening in this space. 
Shopify is looking to further break up their monolith into manageable, 
Ruby or Ruby like chunks.
I, for one am excited to see what's next for Ecommerce in Ruby.
